## Introduction

Utility function to fill your presence on SIX ITB. Use this with care, do not use to violate the ethics and rule that applies at ITB _(e.g: tipsen)_.

## Prerequisites

Having Python >=3.6.

## Installation

To install for personal use, you can do:

```bash
pip install six-presence
```

Here's a sample script:

```py
from six_presence.presence import fill_presence

fill_presence('your-username', 'your-password')
```

I've prepared a simple script to demonstrate the usage of this script in the `scripts` folder for you to check out. You can download the script for yourself.
